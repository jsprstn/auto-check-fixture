		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			
            <p> For our project we partnered with Nahanni Steel—a Brampton-based automotive parts supplier—to produce a device that will validate the presence of a small flanged steel nut on a larger stamped-steel support bracket. The affixing of the flanged nut is the final step in a multi-step process of fabrication, and as such, is the only point in the fabrication process where the success or failure of the final product can be evaluated in-place. 
			
			<br><br>
			
			Once the flanged nut is affixed, the fabrication process is complete, and is passed to a large steel bin (See Appendix C- Process Pictures). Once the run is complete, the entire set of finished parts is shipped to Mexico for ultimate assembly in a General Motors (GM) vehicle.</p>
			
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			
			<p> Because of the complicated, multi-step nature of the fabrication process, there are many potential points of failure; and even a single failure of a single step in a single part--in a production run typically tallying several thousand identical parts--will be identified and noted by GM during assembly. In a competitive automotive supply landscape with many suppliers bidding for the business of a small number of manufacturers, even a single failure represents a potential erosion of GM's confidence in the entire part-production process that Nahanni Steel considers unacceptable</j>
			
			<br><br>
			
			While 99.9%+ of all parts received from Nahanni Steel by GM adhere to spec, every once in several thousand part-cycles the flanged nut fails to affix or is affixed improperly during the final placement-and-welding step. By passing every finished part through a device capable of reliably validating the presence of a correctly-affixed nut, Nahanni Steel will be able to have a high degree of 8 confidence that they’re shipping exactly zero bad parts to GM for assembly. Our challenge was to solve this problem for them.</p>
		<h2>Approach</h2>
			
            <p>After consideration of a number different approaches, we settled on a primarily pneumatic-mechanical solution that evaluates the presence of the flanged nut by aligning the part beneath a downward-descending pneumatic cylinder that triggers an inductive proximity sensor—which releases the part--if the travel distance of the cylinder rod is within the limits associated with the presence of a correctly-affixed nut. We determined that this solution offered the best mix of precision, robustness, and cost compared to the alternative solutions considered. A pre-design concept based on this solution was presented to the production team at Nahanni, who agreed with our assessment, and approved us to proceed with the design. (See final design in Appendix A).
			
			<br><br>

			Separately, we were asked to build a vision-based system to evaluate the presence and orientation of the flanged nut, and integrate a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) to facilitate feedback with the operator. These were to be distinct and separable from the production version we were to deliver to Nahanni, and were assigned to test our knowledge and demonstrate the full range of our skills as electromechanical technologists.</p>

		<h2>Outcome</h2>
			
			<p>The check fixture system was commissioned at the beginning of September. Design work was conducted from September through December. Fabrication, wiring, and assembly were conducted from January through early March. Testing and troubleshooting began concurrently with assembly in February and finished early April, with both Nahanni and Humber check fixture systems meeting or exceeding our target design standards. Both systems were able to reliably and consistently reject all bad parts--across all failure modes--while passing all good parts. 
			
			<br><br>
			
			At the time of writing, Nahanni Steel has not yet taken delivery of the finished system, so they have not yet had the opportunity to perform their own final trials in a production environment. However, after inspecting our system and reviewing our progress to date, they’ve expressed confidence in our final product, and have cleared us to proceed with delivery. Assuming their final trials validate our results, they intend to install and integrate our completed check fixture system into their part-fabrication process. </p>
